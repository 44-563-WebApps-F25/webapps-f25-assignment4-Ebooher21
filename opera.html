            <h4 class = "name point">PIT</h4>       
                <p class = speech>&ensp;And so thou wouldst be a jester eh?<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name wilferd">WFD</h4>     
                <p class = speech>&ensp;Aye!<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name point">PIT</h4>  
                <p class = speech>&ensp;Now, listen! My sweetheart, Elsie Maynard, was
                        secretly wed to this Fairfax half an hour ere he
                        escaped.<br></p>     

            <h4 class = "name wilferd">WFD</h4>     
                <p class = speech>&ensp;She did well.<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name point">PIT</h4>       
                <p class = speech>&ensp;She did nothing of the kind, so hold thy peace and
                        perpend. Now, while he liveth she is dead to me and I
                        to her, and so, my jibes and jokes notwithstanding,<br>&ensp; I
                        am the saddest and the sorriest dog in England!<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name wilferd">WFD</h4>     
                <p class = speech>&ensp;Thou art a very dull dog indeed.<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name point">PIT</h4>       
                <p class = speech>&ensp;Now, if thou wilt swear that thou didst shoot this
                        Fairfax while he was trying to swim across the river—
                        it needs but the discharge of an arquebus<br>&ensp; on a dark
                        night— and that he sank and was seen no more, I'll
                        make thee the very Archbishop of jesters, and that in
                        two days'time! Now, what sayest thou?<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name wilferd">WFD</h4>     
                <p class = speech>&ensp;I am to lie?<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name point">PIT</h4>       
                <p class = speech>&ensp;Heartily. But thy lie must be a lie of circumstance,
                        which I will support with the testimony of eyes,
                        ears,and tongue.<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name wilferd">WFD</h4>     
                <p class = speech>&ensp;And thou wilt qualify me as a jester?<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name point">PIT</h4>       
                <p class = speech>&ensp;As a jester among jesters. I will teach thee all my
                        original songs, my self-constructed riddles, my own
                        ingenious paradoxes;<br>&ensp; nay, more, I will reveal to thee
                        the source whence I get them. Now, what sayest thou?<br></p>

            <h4 class = "name wilferd">WFD</h4>     
                <p class = speech>&ensp;Why, if it be but a lie thou wantest of me, I hold it
                        cheap enough, and I say yes, it is a bargain!<br></p>
            
            <br>

            <p class = direction>[No. 15. Hereupon we're both agreed]</p>

            <h4 class = "name both">BTH</h4>        
                <p class = song>&emsp;Hereupon we're both agreed,
                        All that we two
                            Do agree to
                                We'll secure by solemn deed,
                                    To prevent all
                                        Error mental.<br></p>
