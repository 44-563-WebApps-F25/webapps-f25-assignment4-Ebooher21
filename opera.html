        <h3>Act II [SCENE.— The same— Moonlight.]</h3>
        <p>
            POINT       And so thou wouldst be a jester eh?

            WILFRED     Aye!

            POINT       Now, listen! My sweetheart, Elsie Maynard, was
                        secretly wed to this Fairfax half an hour ere he
                        escaped.

            WILFRED     She did well.

            POINT       She did nothing of the kind, so hold thy peace and
                        perpend. Now, while he liveth she is dead to me and I
                        to her, and so, my jibes and jokes notwithstanding, I
                        am the saddest and the sorriest dog in England!

            WILFRED     Thou art a very dull dog indeed.

            POINT       Now, if thou wilt swear that thou didst shoot this
                        Fairfax while he was trying to swim across the river—
                        it needs but the discharge of an arquebus on a dark
                        night— and that he sank and was seen no more, I'll
                        make thee the very Archbishop of jesters, and that in
                        two days'time! Now, what sayest thou?

            WILFRED     I am to lie?

            POINT       Heartily. But thy lie must be a lie of circumstance,
                        which I will support with the testimony of eyes,
                        ears,and tongue.

            WILFRED     And thou wilt qualify me as a jester?

            POINT       As a jester among jesters. I will teach thee all my
                        original songs, my self-constructed riddles, my own
                        ingenious paradoxes; nay, more, I will reveal to thee
                        the source whence I get them. Now, what sayest thou?

            WILFRED     Why, if it be but a lie thou wantest of me, I hold it
                        cheap enough, and I say yes, it is a bargain!

                        No. 15. Hereupon we're both agreed
                               (DUET)
                        Point and Wilfred

            BOTH        Hereupon we're both agreed,
                        All that we two
                        Do agree to
                        We'll secure by solemn deed,
                        To prevent all
                        Error mental.

            POINT       You on Elsie are to call
                        With a story
                        Grim and gory;

            WILFRED     How this Fairfax died, and all
                        I declare to
                        You're to swear to.

            POINT       I to swear to!

            WILFRED     I declare to,

            POINT       I to swear to!

            WILFRED     I declare to,

            BOTH        I to swear to,/I declare to,
                        You declare to,/You're to swear to,
                        I to swear to,/I declare to.
